    <description>
      <p>Bright light erupts from your form, moving with you and dazzling those around you. You emit bright light in a 50-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 50 feet. Each creature that moves within 10 feet of you for the first time on its turn or that starts its turn within 10 feet of you, must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 3d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and is not blinded</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by1d10 for each slot level above 4th</p>
